## Project Objective
Build a campus Lost & Found web app where users can sign up/login and post lost or found items. Users can edit or delete their posts and use basic search/filter to find items. The app uses Node, Express, vanilla ES6 (client-side rendering), and MongoDB (Node driver), with basic accessibility support.
