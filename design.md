# Project Description

Lost & Found Tracker is a web app for reporting and finding lost items on campus. Users can submit lost or found items with details like name, description, location, and date. They can search or filter items and get notifications when a match is found. The system will include accessibility features for users with disabilities.

# User Personas

## User Persona 1

**Name:** Emma  
**Age:** 20  
**Role:** College Student

### Scenario

Emma is always busy with classes and activities. She sometimes loses small things like her keys, headphones, or student ID on campus. She wants a fast way to report what she lost and check if someone found it.

### Goals

- Report a lost item quickly
- Find out if someone posted a matching found item
- Get her item back as soon as possible

### Needs

- A simple form to create a lost-item post
- Search and filters to browse posts

### Pain Points

- Losing time walking around campus asking people
- Too many posts to scroll without filters
- Not knowing if someone found the item

## User Persona 2

**Name:** John  
**Age:** 35  
**Role:** Campus Staff

### Scenario

John works on campus and often finds lost items in classrooms or public areas. He wants an easy way to log found items so students can claim them.

### Goals

- Help students get their items back safely
- Reduce repeated questions about lost items

### Needs

## User Persona 3

**Name:** Sophie  
**Age:** 22  
**Role:** Student with Visual Impairment

### Scenario

Sophie has visual impairment and may not notice small changes on a page. When she uses the app, she needs very clear feedback after every action. She wants to clearly know if something was successful or if it failed.

### Goals

- Report a lost item by herself
- Understand clearly if her action was successful or not
- Feel confident that the system is responding correctly

### Needs

- Clear and simple page layout
- Different color alerts for success and error
- Different sound alerts for success and failure so she can easily tell the difference
