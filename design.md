## Project Description:

Lost & Found Tracker is a web app for reporting and finding lost items on campus. Users can submit lost or found items with details like name, description, location, and date. They can search or filter items and get notifications when a match is found. The system will include accessibility features for users with disabilities.

## User Personas:

1. College Student (Emma)  
   Emma is a busy college student who sometimes loses small items like keys, headphones, or her ID card. She wants a quick and easy way to report lost items and check if someone has found them.
2. Campus Staff (John)
   John works on campus and often finds lost items in classrooms or public areas. He wants a simple way to log found items so students can get their belongings back.
3. Student with Visual Impairment (Sophie)
   Sophie is a student with visual impairment. She needs clear and accessible pages, including screen-reader-friendly design and easy-to-notice alerts, so she can know when her lost item has been found.
